- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cimiur
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, QA testing and languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a few too many things: Godot, Unity, Python (I have actually already some knowledge of it), how to build websites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything of the above. Unfortunately, at the moment, I haven't got much spare time, but I'm open to new projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: cimiur@gmail.com
